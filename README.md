# Multilingual Image Caption Generation for Visually Impaired

## Overview
This project focuses on building an innovative **multilingual image captioning system** designed to assist visually impaired users. By utilizing **Deep Learning (DL)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, the system generates accurate and context-rich image descriptions across multiple languages.

## Key Features
- **Multilingual Support**: Generates captions in multiple languages for inclusivity.
- **Context-Aware Descriptions**: Leverages advanced DL models to produce accurate, detailed, and contextually relevant image captions.
- **Accessibility**: Tailored for visually impaired users to provide a seamless experience in understanding visual content.

## Key Technologies
- **Deep Learning (DL)**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Python**
- **Computer Vision** (for image processing)
- **Transformers and Attention Mechanisms** (for multilingual support)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multilingual-image-captioning.git
   cd multilingual-image-captioning
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the necessary datasets and models. (Provide details or links here.)

## Usage

1. Run the script to generate captions:
   ```bash
   python generate_captions.py --image <path_to_image> --language <language_code>
   ```

2. Available language codes: `en` (English), `fr` (French), `es` (Spanish), etc.

3. Example:
   ```bash
   python generate_captions.py --image sample.jpg --language en
   ```

## Dataset
- Include details about the datasets used for training and testing the model, and instructions on how to access them.

## Model
- Briefly explain the architecture used (e.g., CNN for image features, Transformer for language translation).

## Future Work
- Expanding support for more languages.
- Improving caption generation accuracy in complex scenarios.
- Integrating with screen reader software for visually impaired users.
